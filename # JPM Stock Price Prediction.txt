# JPM Stock Price Prediction

My machine learning project that tries to predict if JPMorgan Chase stock will go up or down tomorrow using Python.

## What it does

This code downloads JPM stock data and uses a Random Forest model to predict if the stock price will be higher tomorrow. It's basically a "yes/no" prediction system.

## How I built it

1. **Got the data**: Used `yfinance` to download historical stock prices
2. **Made the target**: Created a simple 1/0 label (1 = price goes up, 0 = price goes down)
3. **Started simple**: First tried basic features like Open, High, Low, Close, Volume
4. **Made it better**: Added rolling averages and trend features over different time periods
5. **Fixed the testing**: Used backtesting so the model doesn't "cheat" by seeing future data
6. **Improved predictions**: Only predicts "buy" when the model is really confident (60%+ probability)

## Key features I added

- Price ratios compared to moving averages (2, 5, 60, 250, 1000 days)
- Trend indicators to see if stock has been going up/down recently
- Probability threshold filtering to reduce bad predictions

## What you need to run it

```bash
pip install yfinance pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

## Results

The final model does better than just guessing randomly, but it's pretty conservative - it only makes predictions when it's confident. The precision score shows how accurate the "buy" signals are.

## What I learned

- Stock prediction is really hard!
- Feature engineering makes a big difference
- Being conservative with predictions is better than trying to predict everything
- Backtesting is super important to avoid overfitting

## Disclaimer

This is just a class project - don't actually use this to trade real money! I'm still learning and this definitely isn't investment advice.
